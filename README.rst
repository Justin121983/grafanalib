Getting Started with grafanalib
===============================

grafanalib lets you generate Grafana dashboards from simple Python scripts.

Getting started
===============

grafanalib is just a Python package, so:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install grafanalib

Support
=======

This library is in its very early stages. We'll probably make changes that
break backwards compatibility, although we'll try hard not to.

grafanalib works with Python 3.6 through 3.11.

Developing
==========
If you're working on the project, and need to build from source, it's done as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  $ virtualenv .env
  $ . ./.env/bin/activate
  $ pip install -e .

Configuring Grafana Datasources
===============================

This repo used to contain a program ``gfdatasource`` for configuring
Grafana data sources, but it has been retired since Grafana now has a
built-in way to do it.
